"""Sentences for statements. Placeholders:
    {name}  a single cat's name
    {area}  the area text, e.g. "my neighbors", "the orange cats", "the cats in the grid"
    {n}     the number of liars
    {h}     the number of honest cats (size of the area minus n)
    {a} {b}            the two cats in a pair statement
    {opposite} {then}  the types in an IfThen statement
    {quote}            what a hidden cat supposedly said
One plain wording per kind of clue, so the same logic always looks the same. Only the words
honest and liar, no synonyms. The cat talk is a sound the generator sometimes adds before or
after a clue (CAT_SOUNDS), plus a few puns on the simplest clue.
No negative wordings (not, none, can't, at most, ...): when a liar says one, the player
would have to un-negate twice.
