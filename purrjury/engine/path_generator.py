"""A generator that builds a puzzle along a solving path, so the difficulty is chosen instead of hoped for.

The old generator (generator.py) makes random clues and keeps the puzzle if it happens to work.
This one works the other way round:

    1. Make the grid and decide the liars (the answer), like before.
    2. Decide the order in which a player should find the cats: the path.
    3. Walk along the path. For each step, give one cat a clue that, together with the cats
       found so far, reveals exactly one new cat (the next one on the path if possible).
       The first step has nothing known yet, so its clue is an opener.
    4. When every cat is found, give the cats that still have no clue a "filler" clue that
       doesn't open a shortcut.
    5. Check the result with the solver we already trust (solver.py): it must get through the
       puzzle the way we planned.

The settings (PathSettings) are the knobs: how many cats a step may reveal, how many openers,
and later where a 2-clue step goes.

First version, on purpose:
    - only 1-clue steps (2-clue steps come later)
    - no hidden cats / hearsay yet
